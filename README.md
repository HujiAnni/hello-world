# hello-world! Greeting from Jianni Hu

Hi there! 

Jianni here! I started learning Python and SQL online one year from now, seeking to find a more efficient and smarter way to deal with big datasets and drive insights from the data to solve customer-related problems back in the Luxury and Fashion industry at Prada Group and Bottega Veneta.

I'm currently an MBA candidate at Johnson Cornell Tech, Class of 2021. My goal is to have more hands-on practice of Python and SQL coding and learn R programming for data analytics to find a new role in data science.
